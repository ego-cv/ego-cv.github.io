    <p><strong>When writing a manifesto, it is important to keep this in mind.</strong></p>
    <p>See the world from many angles. Dichotomies are powerful tools if you understand their limits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The world is not perfectly split down any single axis.</li>
        <li>Few things are black and white.</li>
        <li>Dichotomies do not map perfectly onto the territory.</li>
        <li>They are never universal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="file:///c:\ego-cv.github.io\pics\dichotomy.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>However, many models working in unison help avoid making bad decisions in edge cases.</p>
    <p>With <strong>many enough</strong> angles on the same question, you can see its whole shape.</p>
    <p>The natural conclusion of this is to have so many fuzzy models working in parallel that they become fully
        integrated into your thinking and dissolve into a general 'intuition'. If your models are good, this is wisdom.

    <p><em>Previously: I used to want to find the one idea that explained everything — this gave me a lower resolution
            view of the world.</em></p>
    <h2 id="there-are-timeless-truths">There are timeless truths</h2>
    <p>There are timeless truths, many of them sound cliché.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately they are difficult to learn through reading. They seem obvious, but only in retrospect.</p>
    <p>Good advice often goes straight from meaningless, to obvious.</p>
    <p>I cannot learn from reading aphorisms. The best I have managed is to get close to the idea via experience, then
        read a book that points out the idea, gives it a name, gets me the final 10% of the way there. I'm not sure
        there is much wisdom that can be learnt from books alone.</p>
    <p>This is why children ignore their parents' advice, only to give the same advice to their children a few decades
        later.</p>
    <p>Mill putts it nicely in <code>On Liberty</code>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>All languages and literatures are full of general observations on life, both as to what it is, and how to
            conduct oneself in it; observations which everybody knows, which everybody repeats, or hears with
            acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of which most people first truly learn the meaning, when
            experience, generally of a painful kind, has made it a reality to them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I did not understand this passage when I first read it. It was only later, when I discovered the concept for
        myself, that it resonated for me.</p>
    <p>This is why philosophy needs to be rewritten for each generation: to use metaphors closer to our own experiences.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The one effective way we have to pass-on these hard-won lessons is by storing them in morality,
            institutions and ritual — therefore these are valuable and we should think twice before discarding
            them.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Previously: I once thought I could get everything I needed from books. Experience, it turns out, is very
            important.</em></p>
    <h2 id="be-nice">Be nice</h2>
    <p>One of those timeless truths is the power of &quot;tit-for-tat, starting with cooperation&quot;.</p>
    <p>It is irrational to be nasty, most of the time.</p>
    <p>This only holds for iterated prisoner dilemmas where the number of interactions is not known (so a stranger in
        Paris you will never see again? Doesn't hold. A neighbour: holds)</p>
    <p>We should also:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be nice to people <em>be default</em></li>
        <li>Forgive, sometimes, to avoid a cycle of defections</li>
        <li>Protect your reputation as fair but retaliatory (<em>I NEVER FORGIVE. ignore what I wrote above</em>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A group of cooperative players can invade a population of defectors and thrive. The gains from cooperation
        amongst themselves is enough to offset their losses from the 'mean' players.</p>
    <p>So be nice!</p>
    <p>Relevant tweet:</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#39;Being nice&#39; is underrated. &#39;nice&#39; is not a sexy concept, our teachers

    <h2 id="morality-is-useful-it-is-not-real">Morality is <em>useful</em>, it is not <em>real</em></h2>
    <p>(For some definitions of the word 'real')</p>
    <p>Clearly moral realism is ridiculous, given that, how should we behave?</p>
    <p>Egoism? It seems that common sense morality is egoism most of the time.</p>
    <p>Cooperating with others, being nice, caring for friends and family, trying to make the world better.. these are
        the acts of an egoist.</p>
    <p>Our intuitions and moeurs are pretty good heuristics, do what feels right.</p>
    <p>The only thing we can be sure of is that there are no utilitarians, at least no good ones: what parent would
        exchange their child's life for that of two strangers? 100? 1,000,000?</p>
    <p>Imagine a moral nihilist. They do not believe there is any meaning to the concepts of good or evil. <em>They
            personally desire</em> that humanity thrives far into the future. They also empathise with other humans and
        wish for as many of them as possible live happy lives. How can they best leverage their own power to bring this
        about? One way would be to increase the number of utilitarians.</p>
    <p>One person can only do so much themselves, but in spreading utilitarianism virally, can control the resources of
        each person affected.</p>
    <p>Peter Singer can reduce animal suffering by refraining from eating meat, he has reduced it much, much more by
        converting others to veganism.</p>
    <p>It would surprise me if there <em>isn't</em> at least one influential utilitarian philosopher who is a closet
        nihilist, who only <em>pretends</em> to be believe that utilitarianism is true, simply to further their own
        selfish desire to better the world.</p>

    <h2 id="prioritise-tasks-that-compound">Prioritise tasks that compound</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The work of cooking a meal was like a closed circle, completed and gone, leading nowhere. But the work of
            building a path was a living sum, so that no day was left to die behind her, but each day contained all
            those that preceded it, each day acquired its immortality on every succeeding tomorrow.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>minimise</strong>: repetitive tasks that do not build on themselves (routine cooking, cleaning,
                most admin)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>maximise</strong>: Compounding tasks (creative) that build on themselves (writing, reading,
                building relationships, learning..)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Take the long view in maximising: avoid burnout, allow for long walks and hot showers to spark inspiration, sleep
        well, work on things you love.</p>
    <p>Routine tasks can be made into compounding tasks: cooking and eating together as a family strengthens
        relationships.</p>

    <p>For people living in the UK: We do not need to work as much as we do if we do not wish to. We do not need to have
        a new car, a large house, an amazon echo, a gym membership, a new sofa (they are free second hand, this country
        is amazingly rich).</p>
    <p>Every time we pay more for more comfort or enjoyment we are making a trade-off: freedom for stuff.</p>
    <p>Down and out is always an option.</p>
    <h2 id="responsibility-gives-meaning">Responsibility gives meaning</h2>
    <p>However: optimising for freedom alone is probably wrong.</p>
    <p>Living alone in a tent, eating cat-food for dinner, may not be the perfect balance of responsibility to freedom
        for <em>you</em>.</p>
    <p>Taking responsibility for a pet, a family, your community, a business — these are all things that reduce your
        individual freedom while adding meaning to your life.</p>
    <h2 id="fire-in-winter-sun-in-summer">Fire in winter, sun in summer.</h2>
    <p>I feel good when I spend time outdoors. In the summer I am in the sun when possible, in the winter a wood-fire in
        the evening has some of the same benefits.</p>
    <p>It is important to be in nature, amongst green things, running water, and beauty.</p>
