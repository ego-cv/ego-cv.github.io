Handler functions are\n// called one at a time, starting with the base props and then\n// searching through the plugins (in order of appearance) until one of\n// them returns true. For some props, the first plugin that yields a\n// value gets precedence.\n//\n//   handleDOMEvents:: ?Object<(view: EditorView, event: dom.Event) → bool>\n//   Can be an object mapping DOM event type names to functions that\n//   handle them. Such functions will be called before any handling\n//   ProseMirror does of events fired on the editable DOM element.\n//   Contrary to the other event handling props, when returning true\n//   from such a function, you are responsible for calling\n//   `preventDefault` yourself (or not, if you want to allow the\n//   default behavior).\n//\n//   handleKeyDown:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor receives a `keydown` event.\n//\n//   handleKeyPress:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Handler for `keypress` events.\n//\n//   handleTextInput:: ?(view: EditorView, from: number, to: number, text: string) → bool\n//   Whenever the user directly input text, this handler is called\n//   before the input is applied. If it returns `true`, the default\n//   behavior of actually inserting the text is suppressed.\n//\n//   handleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a click, from the inside out. The\n//   `direct` flag will be true for the inner node.\n//\n//   handleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is clicked, after `handleClickOn` handlers\n//   have been called.\n//\n//   handleDoubleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a double click.\n//\n//   handleDoubleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is double-clicked, after `handleDoubleClickOn`.\n//\n//   handleTripleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a triple click.\n//\n//   handleTripleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is triple-clicked, after `handleTripleClickOn`.\n//\n//   handlePaste:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.ClipboardEvent, slice: Slice) → bool\n//   Can be used to override the behavior of pasting. `slice` is the\n//   pasted content parsed by the editor, but you can directly access\n//   the event to get at the raw content.\n//\n//   handleDrop:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.Event, slice: Slice, moved: bool) → bool\n//   Called when something is dropped on the editor. `moved` will be\n//   true if this drop moves from the current selection (which should\n//   thus be deleted).\n//\n//   handleScrollToSelection:: ?(view: EditorView) → bool\n//   Called when the view, after updating its state, tries to scroll\n//   the selection into view. A handler function may return false to\n//   indicate that it did not handle the scrolling and further\n//   handlers or the default behavior should be tried.\n//\n//   createSelectionBetween:: ?(view: EditorView, anchor: ResolvedPos, head: ResolvedPos) → ?Selection\n//   Can be used to override the way a selection is created when\n//   reading a DOM selection between the given anchor and head.\n//\n//   domParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading editor changes\n//   from the DOM. Defaults to calling\n//   [`DOMParser.fromSchema`](#model.DOMParser^fromSchema) on the\n//   editor's schema.\n//\n//   transformPastedHTML:: ?(html: string) → string\n//   Can be used to transform pasted HTML text, _before_ it is parsed,\n//   for example to clean it up.\n//\n//   clipboardParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading content from\n//   the clipboard. When not given, the value of the\n//   [`domParser`](#view.EditorProps.domParser) prop is used.\n//\n//   transformPastedText:: ?(text: string, plain: bool) → string\n//   Transform pasted plain text. The `plain` flag will be true when\n//   the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   clipboardTextParser:: ?(text: string, $context: ResolvedPos, plain: bool) → Slice\n//   A function to parse text from the clipboard into a document\n//   slice. Called after\n//   [`transformPastedText`](#view.EditorProps.transformPastedText).\n//   The default behavior is to split the text into lines, wrap them\n//   in `<p>` tags, and call\n//   [`clipboardParser`](#view.EditorProps.clipboardParser) on it.\n//   The `plain` flag will be true when the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   transformPasted:: ?(Slice) → Slice\n//   Can be used to transform pasted content before it is applied to\n//   the document.\n//\n//   nodeViews:: ?Object<(node: Node, view: EditorView, getPos: () → number, decorations: [Decoration], innerDecorations: DecorationSource) → NodeView>\n//   Allows you to pass custom rendering and behavior logic for nodes\n//   and marks. Should map node and mark names to constructor\n//   functions that produce a [`NodeView`](#view.NodeView) object\n//   implementing the node's display behavior. For nodes, the third\n//   argument `getPos` is a function that can be called to get the\n//   node's current position, which can be useful when creating\n//   transactions to update it. For marks, the third argument is a\n//   boolean that indicates whether the mark's content is inline.\n//\n//   `decorations` is an array of node or inline decorations that are\n//   active around the node. They are automatically drawn in the\n//   normal way, and you will usually just want to ignore this, but\n//   they can also be used as a way to provide context information to\n//   the node view without adding it to the document itself.\n//\n//   `innerDecorations` holds the decorations for the node's content.\n//   You can safely ignore this if your view has no content or a\n//   `contentDOM` property, since the editor will draw the decorations\n//   on the content. But if you, for example, want to create a nested\n//   editor with the content, it may make sense to provide it with the\n//   inner decorations.\n//\n//   clipboardSerializer:: ?DOMSerializer\n//   The DOM serializer to use when putting content onto the\n//   clipboard. If not given, the result of\n//   [`DOMSerializer.fromSchema`](#model.DOMSerializer^fromSchema)\n//   will be used.\n//\n//   clipboardTextSerializer:: ?(Slice) → string\n//   A function that will be called to get the text for the current\n//   selection when copying text to the clipboard. By default, the\n//   editor will use [`textBetween`](#model.Node.textBetween) on the\n//   selected range.\n//\n//   decorations:: ?(state: EditorState) → ?DecorationSource\n//   A set of [document decorations](#view.Decoration) to show in the\n//   view.\n//\n//   editable:: ?(state: EditorState) → bool\n//   When this returns false, the content of the view is not directly\n//   editable.\n//\n//   attributes:: ?union<Object<string>, (EditorState) → ?Object<string>>\n//   Control the DOM attributes of the editable element. May be either\n//   an object or a function going from an editor state to an object.\n//   By default, the element will get a class `\"ProseMirror\"`, and\n//   will have its `contentEditable` attribute determined by the\n//   [`editable` prop](#view.EditorProps.editable). Additional classes\n//   provided here will be added to the class. For other attributes,\n//   the value provided first (as in\n//   [`someProp`](#view.EditorView.someProp)) will be used.\n//\n//   scrollThreshold:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the distance (in pixels) between the cursor and the\n//   end of the visible viewport at which point, when scrolling the\n//   cursor into view, scrolling takes place. Defaults to 0.\n//\n//   scrollMargin:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the extra space (in pixels) that is left above or\n//   below the cursor when it is scrolled into view. Defaults to 5.\n\n// DirectEditorProps:: interface extends EditorProps\n//\n// The props object given directly to the editor view supports two\n// fields that can't be used in plugins:\n//\n//   state:: EditorState\n//   The current state of the editor.\n//\n//   dispatchTransaction:: ?(tr: Transaction)\n//   The callback over which to send transactions (state updates)\n//   produced by the view. If you specify this, you probably want to\n//   make sure this ends up calling the view's\n//   [`updateState`](#view.EditorView.updateState) method with a new\n//   state that has the transaction\n//   [applied](#state.EditorState.apply). The callback will be bound to have\n//   the view instance as its `this` binding.\n\nexport { Decoration, DecorationSet, EditorView, endComposition as __endComposition, parseFromClipboard as __parseFromClipboard, serializeForClipboard as __serializeForClipboard };\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.es.js.map\n","import { Extension } from '@tiptap/core';\nimport { Plugin, PluginKey } from 'prosemirror-state';\nimport { DecorationSet, Decoration } from 'prosemirror-view';\n\nconst FocusClasses = Extension.create({\r\n    name: 'focus',\r\n    defaultOptions: {\r\n        className: 'has-focus',\r\n        mode: 'all',\r\n    },\r\n    addProseMirrorPlugins() {\r\n        return [\r\n            new Plugin({\r\n                key: new PluginKey('focus'),\r\n                props: {\r\n                    decorations: ({ doc, selection }) => {\r\n                        const { isEditable, isFocused } = this.editor;\r\n                        const { anchor } = selection;\r\n                        const decorations = [];\r\n                        if (!isEditable || !isFocused) {\r\n                            return DecorationSet.create(doc, []);\r\n                        }\r\n                        // Maximum Levels\r\n                        let maxLevels = 0;\r\n                        if (this.options.mode === 'deepest') {\r\n                            doc.descendants((node, pos) => {\r\n                                if (node.isText) {\r\n                                    return;\r\n                                }\r\n                                const isCurrent = anchor >= pos && anchor <= (pos + node.nodeSize - 1);\r\n                                if (!isCurrent) {\r\n                                    return false;\r\n                                }\r\n                                maxLevels += 1;\r\n                            });\r\n                        }\r\n                        // Loop through current\r\n                        let currentLevel = 0;\r\n                        doc.descendants((node, pos) => {\r\n                            if (node.isText) {\r\n                                return false;\r\n                            }\r\n                            const isCurrent = anchor >= pos && anchor <= (pos + node.nodeSize - 1);\r\n                            if (!isCurrent) {\r\n                                return false;\r\n                            }\r\n                            currentLevel += 1;\r\n                            const outOfScope = (this.options.mode === 'deepest' && maxLevels - currentLevel > 0)\r\n                                || (this.options.mode === 'shallowest' && currentLevel > 1);\r\n                            if (outOfScope) {\r\n                                return this.options.mode === 'deepest';\r\n                            }\r\n                            decorations.push(Decoration.node(pos, pos + node.nodeSize, {\r\n                                class: this.options.className,\r\n                            }));\r\n                        });\r\n                        return DecorationSet.create(doc, decorations);\r\n                    },\r\n                },\r\n            }),\r\n        ];\r\n    },\r\n});\n\nexport default FocusClasses;\nexport { FocusClasses };\n//# sourceMappingURL=tiptap-extension-focus.esm.js.map\n","var check = function (it) {\n  return it && it.Math == Math && it;\n};\n\n// https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/86#issuecomment-115759028\nmodule.exports =\n  // eslint-disable-next-line es/no-global-this -- safe\n  check(typeof globalThis == 'object' && globalThis) ||\n  check(typeof window == 'object' && window) ||\n  // eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-globals -- safe\n  check(typeof self == 'object' && self) ||\n  check(typeof global == 'object' && global) ||\n  // eslint-disable-next-line no-new-func -- fallback\n  (function () { return this; })() || Function('return this')();\n","var internalObjectKeys = require('../internals/object-keys-internal');\nvar enumBugKeys = require('../internals/enum-bug-keys');\n\n// `Object.keys` method\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object.keys\n// eslint-disable-next-line es/no-object-keys -- safe\nmodule.exports = Object.keys || function keys(O) {\n  return internalObjectKeys(O, enumBugKeys);\n};\n","var has = require('../internals/has');\nvar toObject = require('../internals/to-object');\nvar sharedKey = require('../internals/shared-key');\nvar CORRECT_PROTOTYPE_GETTER = require('../internals/correct-prototype-getter');\n\nvar IE_PROTO = sharedKey('IE_PROTO');\nvar ObjectPrototype = Object.prototype;\n\n// `Object.getPrototypeOf` method\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object.getprototypeof\n// eslint-disable-next-line es/no-object-getprototypeof -- safe\nmodule.exports = CORRECT_PROTOTYPE_GETTER ?
