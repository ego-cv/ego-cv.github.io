When\n//   `getAttrs` is provided, it takes precedence.\n//\n//   getAttrs:: ?(union<dom.Node, string>) → ?union<Object, false>\n//   A function used to compute the attributes for the node or mark\n//   created by this rule. Can also be used to describe further\n//   conditions the DOM element or style must match. When it returns\n//   `false`, the rule won't match. When it returns null or undefined,\n//   that is interpreted as an empty/default set of attributes.\n//\n//   Called with a DOM Element for `tag` rules, and with a string (the\n//   style's value) for `style` rules.\n//\n//   contentElement:: ?union<string, (dom.Node) → dom.Node>\n//   For `tag` rules that produce non-leaf nodes or marks, by default\n//   the content of the DOM element is parsed as content of the mark\n//   or node. If the child nodes are in a descendent node, this may be\n//   a CSS selector string that the parser must use to find the actual\n//   content element, or a function that returns the actual content\n//   element to the parser.\n//\n//   getContent:: ?(dom.Node, schema: Schema) → Fragment\n//   Can be used to override the content of a matched node.
