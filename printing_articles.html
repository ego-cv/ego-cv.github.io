    <h2 id="madness">Madness</h2>
    <p>An article saved to instapaper is sure to be ignored, a pile of paper has a certain weight. It exists in the same
        space as we do: printed writing wants to be picked up and flipped through, a passage catches your eye, you are
        drawn in.</p>
    <p>I have recently bought a new laser printer, so have started printing articles out, like an old man.</p>
    <p>The cost and hassle of actually doing this is enough friction that I only print things I think are worth it,
        adding a valuable layer of filter onto the <code>internet → instapaper → brain</code> pipeline. The printed
        articles are getting read while the unprinted ones can continue to rot in instapaper.</p>
    <p><em>(This is a similar idea to the recently launched <a
                href="https://waldenpond.press/">https://waldenpond.press/</a> They are a paid service that prints
            articles for you and sends you a monthly booklet.)</em></p>
    <h2 id="method">Method</h2>
    <p>For instapaper, the following stylesheet applied using Stylus improves the layout</p>
    <pre><code class="language-css"><div>@<span class="hljs-keyword">media</span> print {
    <span class="hljs-comment">/* hide link urls */</span>
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span><span class="hljs-selector-attr">[href]</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:after</span> {
        <span class="hljs-attribute">content</span>: <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;
    }

    <span class="hljs-selector-id">#story</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span> {
        <span class="hljs-attribute">text-decoration</span>: underline;
    }
    
    <span class="hljs-comment">/* increase padding slightly */</span>
    <span class="hljs-selector-id">#story</span> {
        <span class="hljs-attribute">padding</span>: <span class="hljs-number">15px</span>;
    }
}
</div></code></pre>
    <p>This gives a comfortable line length and larger margins giving more space for notes. It also hides the URL, just
        showing an underlined link title.</p>
    <p>The article should be printed in booklet mode, both sided, it comes out something like this (this was before the
        custom stylesheet was added, so you can see the horrible URL in the body)</p>
    <p><img src="file:///c:\ego-cv.github.io\pics\printing-articles-slack.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>The paper in folded in half, and stapled through the stack into a piece of cardboard, then the legs of the staple
        folded over to 'bind' the booklet.</p>
    <p>For PDFs, the adobe acrobat printing interface is better than the system one. &quot;fit to page&quot; in booklet
        mode works well. Below is a test of the 60 page &quot;On grace and dignity&quot; (15 sheets of paper). The
        booklet is quite thick at this point on standard weight paper. This method might not work well above 60 pages.
        Any more and it would be better to try to find a professionally printed book version.</p>
    <p><img src="file:///c:\ego-cv.github.io\pics\printing-articles-grace.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>Staplers struggle with this many pages, so it has been bound with paperclips. I'm sure you could sew it
        beautifully, but I don't need a new hobby right now, and I'm pretty sure book-binding would become a hobby if I
        dared try it once.</p>
    <h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
    <p>Some will see this as a waste of paper. My response is that I also use bottled water to make my coffee.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Toner £53 for 2,600 pages (depending on the amount of print on the page)</li>
        <li>Paper £20 for 2,500 sheets</li>
        <li>Each printed page is around 2.92p</li>
        <li>In booklet mode, we get 4 pages per sheet, so 1.3p per page</li>
        <li>For example, a <em>22 page article uses 6 pieces of paper, and costs 29p to print</em>.</li>
    </ul>
